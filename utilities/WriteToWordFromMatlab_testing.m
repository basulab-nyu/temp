function WriteToWordFromMatlab_testing
% -------------------------------------------------------------------
% File: WriteToWordFromMatlab
% Descr:  This is an example of how to control MS-Word from Matlab.
%         With the subfunctions below it is simple to automatically
%         let Matlab create reports in MS-Word.
%         This example copies two Matlab figures into MS-Word, writes
%         some text and inserts a table.
%         Works with MS-Word 2003 at least.
%         Reported to work with later versions of MS-Word as well.
%         MS-Word developer reference:
